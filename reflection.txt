Introduction. 
    I attempted to develop an intelligent agent capable of playing Tic-Tac_Toe and Connect Four using three distinct adversarial
search algorithms: minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and alpha-beta cutoff.

Methods. 
    For the implementation of minimax and alpha-beta pruning, I followed the pseudocode provided on Canvas. I referred to pseudocode
from an online source (https://www.massey.ac.nz/~mjjohnso/notes/59302/l05.html) for the implementation of alpha-beta cutoff. 
    To evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms, I ran several tests. Firstly, I pitted the minimax and alpha-beta pruning
agents against myself in games of Tic-Tac-Toe. I also tried to have alpha-beta cutoff algorithm play against me in Connect Four. To
further explore the capabilities of the algorithms, I set up a match between the minimax and alpha-beta pruning agents, having them
compete against each other in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. These tests allowed me to assess the performance and efficiency of the
implemented algorithms and different game scenarios.

Results.
Did your system work? 
How well? 
Provide tables / numerical results if appropriate.

    The implementation of both minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms showed excellent performance when playing 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe,
whether against me or each other. Throughout all the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe trials conducted, the final player scores consistently resulted
in a tie, with both players achieving a score of 0.5. This outcome indicates well-balanced gameplay (or I'm just too good).
    However, when I attempted ro run trials using the alpha-beta pruning agent in 4x4 or 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe, I encountered significant
performance issues. The algorithm became exceedingly slow, rendering it unable to complete the game effectively when the dimension
of the board becomes too big.
    
    The result of alpha-beta cutoff:

Discussion. 
Based on your results, were your methods and choices appropriate for the task? 
What would you do differently next time? 
Or if you had more time? 
Are there any ethical implications of your system that others should be aware of?
